# Validates the code-graph dual-engine integration shipped in v2.8:
#   (a) SKILL.md frontmatter (name, description) and required sections present.
#   (b) SKILL.md does NOT contain `graphify claude install` as a positive instruction.
#       It MAY appear inside Anti-Rationalizations / Red Flags / Process step text only
#       as a prohibition. We allow occurrences only on lines that also mention
#       'forbidden', 'never', 'do not', 'block', 'kill-switch', or 'red flag' (case-
#       insensitive) — anywhere else is a positive use and fails.
#   (c) SKILL.md documents engine selection (Step 0) and a fallback path.
#   (d) The integrations rule exists and contains the mandatory Anti-patterns section.
#   (e) ADR-0007 exists.
#   (f) Bootstrap scripts exist, are executable, and do NOT write to .claude/settings*.
#   (g) Slash command exists with frontmatter description.
# Contract introduced in v2.8.
