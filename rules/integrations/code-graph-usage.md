# Code knowledge graph usage

Architecture questions over a non-trivial codebase ("how does X work?", "what depends on Y?", "where is Z called?") are answered against a persisted graph, not by re-reading files. The plugin uses `codebase-memory-mcp` as its single code-graph engine, governed by the `code-graph` skill. This rule defines the inviolable contract any consumer project agrees to when it imports the rule. (Pre-v4.0 the plugin shipped a second engine, graphify; it was deprecated in ADR-0013.)

## Inviolable rules

1. Before answering any architecture, dependency, or large-refactor question, the agent runs the `code-graph` skill (Step 0 — engine availability). If the engine is not functional, the agent instructs `bash tools/setup-code-graph.sh` and stops; it does not improvise from `Glob` + `Grep`.
2. Every architectural claim made in a session that has consulted the graph cites either a graph node ID or a `file:line` reference. Claims without a source are rejected in code review.
3. Every answer that relied on the graph names the engine in brackets (`[via codebase-memory-mcp]`). Anonymous claims that depend on the graph are a violation.
4. The `graphify claude install` command is never invoked, in any context — it modifies `.claude/settings.json` and the v2.7 kill-switch in `hooks/delegation-guard.sh` blocks it. graphify is no longer supported by this plugin (ADR-0013); the prohibition is preserved because the upstream command still exists as a footgun.
5. Generated index artifacts (`~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp/`, any `CBM_CACHE_DIR` override pointing inside the repo, or legacy `graphify-out/` from pre-v4.0 repos) are listed in the project `.gitignore`. They are never committed.

## Allowed patterns

```text
# Good — answer cites engine and sources
[via codebase-memory-mcp] The payment flow has three entry points:
  - api/checkout.py:42 (POST /checkout)
  - api/webhook.py:18 (POST /webhook/stripe)
  - workers/retry.py:73 (cron retry)
Top called modules from those entries: services/orders.py (12 paths),
services/inventory.py (5 paths). Source: trace_call_path tool with depth=4.
```

```text
# Good — answer flags graph staleness rather than ignoring it
[via codebase-memory-mcp] index_status reports last_indexed_at 38h ago and
4 commits since. Re-running --scan first. (Then: actual answer.)
```

```bash
# Good — engine installed via the bootstrap, not via upstream auto-config
bash ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/batuta-agent-skills/tools/setup-code-graph.sh
```

## Anti-patterns

**Mandatory section.**

```text
# Bad — violates rule 1 (architecture answer without consulting the graph)
"This codebase uses a pub/sub model with three queues" ← no node ID, no file:line, no engine cited
```

```text
# Bad — violates rule 2 (claim without source)
"The retry worker depends on the payments service." ← no file:line, no graph node
```

```text
# Bad — violates rule 3 (engine not named)
"There are two cycles between orders and inventory." ← which tool produced this? trace_call_path? query_graph? unclear
```

```bash
# Bad — violates rule 4 (running graphify's auto-installer that edits settings.json)
graphify claude install
```

```text
# Bad — violates rule 5 (legacy graphify-out committed)
$ git log --oneline graphify-out/
abc1234 feat: add graph snapshot   ← should never be committed (legacy artifact pre-v4.0)
```

## Documented exceptions

- **Repos under 1,000 LOC**: rule 1 is relaxed. For very small codebases, re-reading is faster than indexing. The skill detects this and skips Step 2 with a note to the operator.
- **Audit chain subagents** (`code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `test-engineer`): when the diff is empty (NOT-APPLICABLE in their Step 0), they do not need to consult the graph. Rule 1 fires only when there is a diff or an architecture question to answer.
