#   - Written by `skills/batuta-skill-authoring` Step 4 (post-v3.8 SKILL.md).
#   - Valid for 60 minutes. Older markers are ignored.
#   - File `touch`-style mtime is the truth, not the filename ISO suffix —
#     `find` checks mtime so a stale marker with a fresh filename does not pass.

RULE violated (skill-authoring gate, v3.8): cannot create new SKILL.md at:
  $file_path

No fresh authoring marker found at $marker_dir/.authoring-marker-skill-* (markers expire after 60 minutes).

Required workflow before creating a SKILL.md:

  1. Invoke the skill: /skill batuta-skill-authoring
  2. Complete its workflow end-to-end (Steps 1–3: discovery, scaffolding, conventions).
  3. Step 4 of the skill writes the marker file. Do not skip it.
  4. Then re-attempt the Write — it will pass.

To bypass for legitimate cosmetic edits during a rebase, restart Claude Code
with the operator-side env var:

  BATUTA_SKILL_AUTHORING_BYPASS=1 claude

Full rule: $plugin_root/rules/authoring/skill-authoring-required.md
