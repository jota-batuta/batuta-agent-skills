# Batuta Agent Skills

**A Claude Code plugin that turns the main agent into a delegation-only architectural seat.** Forked from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) and extended with runtime enforcement, a Haiku tier, and a project-wide doc graph.

Read these in order to understand the project:

1. [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) — vision, problem, success metrics
2. [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md) — architecture overview (5 base agents + agent-architect, hook layer, audit chain, doc graph)
3. [`docs/DELEGATION-RULE.md`](docs/DELEGATION-RULE.md) — Rule #0 contract (the main agent never edits code; mandatory audit chain)
4. [`docs/DELEGATION-RULE-SPECIALISTS.md`](docs/DELEGATION-RULE-SPECIALISTS.md) — when and how `agent-architect` creates project-local domain specialists
5. [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — decision records (Rule #0, Haiku tier, hook vs permissions, sequential audit chain)
6. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — project conventions and session-handoff protocol

If you're switching from Claude Code to another tool mid-feature (token budget, pair programming, etc.), read [`docs/PORTABILITY.md`](docs/PORTABILITY.md).

## Architecture in one paragraph

The plugin ships **six agents** — five base (`implementer` Sonnet, `implementer-haiku` Haiku, `code-reviewer` Sonnet, `test-engineer` Sonnet, `security-auditor` Sonnet) and one meta-agent (`agent-architect` Sonnet) — all with explicit `model:` declarations to prevent silent Opus inheritance. A **plugin-level PreToolUse hook** (`hooks/delegation-guard.sh`) blocks the main agent from editing source code unless the target path falls under a narrow whitelist (`specs/`, `docs/`, `.claude/commands/`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.). Subagents bypass the hook via `agent_id` verification; their tool scope is enforced by their own frontmatter. After implementation, a **sequential audit chain** runs `test-engineer` → `code-reviewer` → `security-auditor` with a literal `AUDIT RESULT: APPROVED|BLOCKED` contract. The main does not close a task without three APPROVED verdicts. When a slice needs domain expertise the base agents don't cover, `agent-architect` creates a project-local specialist at `<project>/.claude/agents/<name>.md` with discovery-first to avoid duplicates.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add jota-batuta/batuta-agent-skills
/plugin install batuta-agent-skills@batuta-agent-skills
```

Or, for local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jota-batuta/batuta-agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/batuta-agent-skills
```

After installing, the plugin's PreToolUse hook is active in every session where the plugin is enabled. The main agent's first attempt to edit a path outside the whitelist will be blocked with an actionable message pointing at the four delegation alternatives.

Optional dependency used internally by `batuta-skill-authoring`:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/skills --skill find-skills
```

## What you get

```

Attribution for upstream and vendored sources lives in [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Layers

The plugin contains two independent layers. They do not overlap; pick the right one for the content you are adding.

| Layer | Question | Activation | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`skills/`](skills/) | "What do I do when *X* situation arises?" | Auto-invocation by Claude Code via skill description matching | `SKILL.md` per directory with `name`/`description` frontmatter |
| [`rules/`](rules/) | "How must the code look *always*?" | Explicit `@<path>` import from a project's `CLAUDE.md` | Plain Markdown with light frontmatter (`title`/`applies-to`/`last-reviewed`) |

`skills/` carries 26 procedures (20 upstream + 6 Batuta-specific). `rules/` carries declarative invariants imported à la carte by consumer projects via `@.claude/rules/<rule>.md` (project-relative path resolved through symlinks created by `tools/setup-rules.sh`). New rules require passing the `batuta-rule-authoring` admission gate. See [`rules/README.md`](rules/README.md) for the full layer documentation and [`rules/_meta/how-to-import.md`](rules/_meta/how-to-import.md) for the consumer protocol.

## Merging upstream updates

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Expect conflicts in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `agents/*.md`, `hooks/hooks.json`, and `docs/`. The Batuta architecture (Rule #0, hook, audit chain, doc graph) supersedes upstream defaults — preserve Batuta on every conflict unless the upstream change is a bugfix in a skill body.

## Cross-tool portability

The plugin's runtime enforcement (hook, audit chain, agent delegation) is specific to **Claude Code 1.x**. The doc graph (PRD/SPEC/ADRs/plans/sessions) is plain Markdown and ports to any tool that reads project files. If you need to continue work in Cursor, Codex CLI, Aider, or another tool, see [`docs/PORTABILITY.md`](docs/PORTABILITY.md) for what survives the switch and how to self-enforce Rule #0 without the hook.

# Agent Skills (upstream)

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

7 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Quick Start

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (recommended)</b></summary>

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add addyosmani/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@addy-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or switch to HTTPS for fetches only:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf "git@github.com:"
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Uses agent-driven skill execution via `AGENTS.md` and the `skill` tool. The Batuta runtime layer (Rule #0 hook, audit chain, agent delegation) is **not available** on OpenCode — only the skill-routing surface ports. See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex CLI / Cursor / Aider / Gemini CLI / Windsurf / other tools</b></summary>

Skills and the doc graph (PRD, SPEC, ADRs, plans, sessions) are plain Markdown and load into any tool that reads project files. **The Batuta runtime layer is Claude Code-only.** If you switch tools mid-feature, read [docs/PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md) for the checklist of what survives, what does not, and how to self-enforce Rule #0 without the hook.

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                   │
│                                             │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name           │  │
│  │ description: Use when [trigger]       │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                             │
│  Overview         → What this skill does    │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions   │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow   │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals     │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).
